# Development
April 23, 2020:
Added objects and functionality to move them with imgui.

April 28, 2020:
Added in relish and mustard. Also have a seperate hotdog and bun. Seperated the objects into their own classes 
for organization and modulization. The objects can also now have name changes and ingredient type changes
which will make it even easier for customization. 
Also I updated the navigation to flow better. Before there were some key controls that were incorrect and
made the application difficult to navigate. Also since the ingredients can be moved to new locations, 
I decided circumnavigating (0,0,0) would not be the best idea. 

April 30, 2020: Added in changes for the perspective and the background color


Plans for the next week:
Add special feature toppings that a player can't manually add. The toppings will fall
from the sky and the player needs to move the whole hot dog to "catch" them. 

May 2, 2020: Created an item dropper class and implemented the items to drop after a certain amount
of seconds and also made the drop rate a constant. Currently the items drop relative to the y positions of the
hot dog.
